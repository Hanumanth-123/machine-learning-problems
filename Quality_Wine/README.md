Problem statement : Given input dataset contains wine feautures with different ingredients like 
1 - fixed acidity 
2 - volatile acidity 
3 - citric acid 
4 - residual sugar 
5 - chlorides 
6 - free sulfur dioxide 
7 - total sulfur dioxide 
8 - density 
9 - pH 
10 - sulphates 
11 - alcohol 
Output variable (based on sensory data): 
12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

The goal is to predict the quality of wine for the future samples.Please be advised the given dataset is imbalanced.
Here I have balanced the data first and developed a model using Decision tree algorithm with good accuracy.
